🔍 Day 1 – Exploring Nmap and Nessus (Port Scanning) Author: Santhosh Kumar Date: 20-10-2025

✨ Introduction This repository marks the beginning of my hands-on journey into network reconnaissance, focusing on port scanning with both Nmap and Nessus tools.
The project covers discovering open ports, analyzing running services, and interpreting scan results effectively—critical skills for cybersecurity practitioners.

📂 Repository Layout Task 1 Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports/
Detailed_Report.docx ← A detailed report document for the project 
README.md ← Main documentation and overview file of the repository
scan_results.txt ← Plain text scan results output
scan_results.xml ← XML formatted scan results output

⚙️ Tools & Methods Nmap – for versatile network discovery and security auditing
Nessus – for advanced vulnerability scanning with configurable port scans 
Command-Line Interface – for running scan commands 
Markdown – for documentation and analysis delivery

🚩 Key Takeaways Gained practical experience with both basic and advanced scanning techniques using Nmap 
Leveraged Nessus to perform comprehensive port scanning and vulnerability assessment Generated and interpreted multiple output file types from the scans 
Compiled findings into a clear, organized analysis report Created a well-structured, shareable GitHub repository for reference and learning

🔮 Road Ahead This is the foundational Day 1 of my network security exploration. 
Future work will delve into more advanced scanning methods, service enumeration, and vulnerability analysis to enhance practical cybersecurity skills and knowledge.
